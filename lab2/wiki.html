          <h2>Ponyo</h2>
          <p>
            Ponyo (Japanese: 崖の上のポニョ, Hepburn: Gake no Ue no Ponyo,
            lit. 'Ponyo on the Cliff')[note 1] is a 2008 Japanese animated
            fantasy film written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki. It was animated
            by
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_Ghibli"
              >Studio Ghibli</a
            >
            for the Nippon Television Network, Dentsu, Hakuhodo DY Media
            Partners, Buena Vista Home Entertainment, Mitsubishi, and
            distributed by Toho. The film stars Yuria Nara, Hiroki Doi, Tomoko
            Yamaguchi, Kazushige Nagashima, Yūki Amami, George Tokoro, Rumi
            Hiiragi, Akiko Yano, Kazuko Yoshiyuki and Tomoko Naraoka. It is the
            eighth film Miyazaki directed for Studio Ghibli, and his tenth
            overall. The film tells the story of Ponyo, a goldfish who escapes
            from the ocean and is helped by a five-year-old human boy, Sōsuke,
            after she is washed ashore while trapped in a glass jar. As they
            bond with each other, Ponyo desires to become a human girl, against
            the devastating circumstances brought about by her acquisition and
            use of magic.
          </p>
          <p>
            The film was originally released in Japan on July 19, 2008 by
            distributor Toho. It was a major commercial success, grossing over
            $204 million worldwide and becoming the eighth-highest-grossing
            anime film of all time. It received critical acclaim for its
            uplifting themes, visual design, and simultaneous appeal towards
            young children and all audiences.
          </p>
          <p>
            An English-language version of the film was released on August 14,
            2009 to 927 theatres across the U.S., the widest opening for a
            Studio Ghibli film in the U.S. It was produced by The
            Kennedy/Marshall Company and released by Walt Disney Pictures.

          <h2>Plot</h2>
          <p>
            Fujimoto, a once-human wizard, lives underwater with his daughter
            Brunhilde and her numerous smaller sisters. While she and her
            siblings are on an outing with their father in his four-flippered
            submarine, Brunhilde sneaks off and floats away on the back of a
            jellyfish. After an encounter with a fishing trawler, she becomes
            trapped in a glass jar and drifts to the shore of a small fishing
            town where she is rescued by a five-year-old boy named Sōsuke. While
            shattering the jar with a rock, Sōsuke cuts his finger. Brunhilde
            licks his blood, healing the wound almost instantly. Sōsuke names
            her Ponyo and promises to protect her. Meanwhile, a distraught
            Fujimoto searches frantically for his lost daughter whom he believes
            to have been kidnapped. He calls his wave spirits to recover her,
            leaving Sōsuke heartbroken and confused by what happened.
          </p>

          <p>
            Gran Mamare arrives at Fujimoto's submarine. Sōsuke's father,
            Kōichi, sees her traveling and recognizes her as the Goddess of
            Mercy. Fujimoto notices the moon appears to be falling out of its
            orbit and satellites are falling like shooting stars, symptoms of
            the dangerous imbalance of nature that now exists. Gran Mamare
            declares that if Sōsuke can pass a test, Ponyo can live as a human
            and the balance of nature will be restored. Fujimoto, still worried,
            reminds her that if Sōsuke fails the test, Ponyo will turn into sea
            foam.
          </p>

          <p>
            The next day, Sōsuke and Ponyo find that most of the land around the
            house has been covered by the ocean. Since it is impossible for Lisa
            to come home, the two decide to find her. With Ponyo's magic, they
            make Sōsuke's pop pop boat bigger to traverse the waters, seeing
            marine life from the Late Devonian period and more people on boats.
            When they reach the forest, however, Ponyo tires and falls asleep,
            and the boat slowly reverts back to its original size. Sōsuke drags
            Ponyo to the shore, where he finds Lisa's abandoned car. As they
            continue walking, Ponyo mysteriously reverts to her fish form.
            Meanwhile, Lisa and the residents of the nursing home are
            temporarily able to breathe water because of Gran Mamare. Ponyo and
            Sōsuke encounter Fujimoto, who warns the boy on the imbalance of
            nature, begs him to return Ponyo to him. Despite their attempt to
            flee, they are captured, and Fujimoto takes them down to the
            protected nursing home.
          </p>

          <p>
            Sōsuke reunites with Lisa and meets Gran Mamare, with whom Lisa has
            just had a long private conversation. Gran Mamare asks him if he can
            love Ponyo whether she is a fish or human; Sōsuke confirms that he
            does. She then tells her daughter that if she chooses to become
            human once and for all, she will have to give up her magical powers.
            Ponyo agrees, and she is encased in a bubble given to Sōsuke, who is
            instructed to kiss it to complete Ponyo's transformation, as the
            balance of nature is restored. The previously stranded ships head
            back to port. Fujimoto respects his daughter's choice, having
            decided he can trust Sōsuke. Ponyo then joyfully jumps high in the
            air and kisses Sōsuke, completing her transformation as a human.

          <h2>Production</h2>
          <p>
            Hayao Miyazaki, the film's director and writer, was prompted to
            create Ponyo after producer Toshio Suzuki suggested he make a film
            aimed at children, noting the success of Howl's Moving Castle
            (2004).[7] The film would be created from a mixture of real-world
            and fictional influences, combined with a desire to implement new
            art and animation approaches developed by other Studio Ghibli staff
            in a feature-length film.[8] In 2004 and 2005, Miyazaki spent time
            in Tomonoura, a seaside town in Setonaikai National Park, where he
            familiarised himself with its community and environment. His
            experience in Tomonoura established the kind of setting he wanted
            for his next film.[9][10] During his time there, he read the
            complete works of Natsume Sōseki. He took particular interest in The
            Gate, a book involving a character named Sōsuke who lived at the
            bottom of a cliff. This provided him more concrete ideas for
            characters and settings.[11] Initially, Miyazaki solely considered
            the concept of a film that would depict a stormy sea with "waves
            higher than the house on a hillside". He later created the character
            Ponyo, a name he thought of as an onomatopoeia of what "soft,
            squishy softness" feels like when touched.[12] Miyazaki recalled
            that as a nine-year-old he borrowed a copy of Hans Christian
            Andersen's "The Little Mermaid" from his neighbour, and that while
            he was reading it, he had difficulty accepting its premise that its
            protagonist did not have a soul.[13]
          </p>
          <p>
            When preparing pre-production materials, Miyazaki hit a creative
            block before visiting the Tate Britain art museum, where he found
            himself startled by an 1852 painting named Ophelia done by English
            painter John Everett Millais and its attention to detail. He
            remarked, "I thought, my work is shoddy compared to those artists. I
            was just astonished. At that point, it became clear to me. Our
            animation style could not go on as before."[14] At the time Katsuya
            Kondō, Miyazaki's colleague, had been the animation director of
            House Hunting (2006), a 12-minute short film made for screening at
            the Ghibli Museum. The short used solid and simple lines, and
            largely used hand-drawn animation. During the production of the
            short, Kondō had discussed the possibility of producing a
            feature-length film like this. Kondō accepted an offer to work on
            the next Studio Ghibli feature film soon after completing the short,
            identifying an opportunity to progress the ideas behind House
            Hunting with more consideration to story.[15]
          </p>
          <p>
            Production of Ponyo began in May 2006. Kondō was given the role of
            animation supervisor, and worked closely with Miyazaki in outlining
            a set of goals that defined the direction of the project, including
            the use of traditional animation throughout production.[8] Borrowing
            from Kondō's experience in animating House Hunting, Ponyo would use
            solid and simple lines; in isolating basic animation elements, the
            film would aim to demonstrate the advantages of hand drawn animation
            through the depiction of motion that cannot be reproduced in any
            other medium.[8][15] An example of the simple style is when Miyazaki
            painted a picture of Ponyo riding on a flock of fish, called "Ponyo
            is Here", which was inspired by him listening to Ride of the
            Valkyries while writing a letter to his staff about going with a
            more elemental style. This would later become a scene in the
            film.[16] In normal productions, animating a sailing ship would
            usually involve drawing one cel and sliding it across the frame,
            which would fix it in a predefined perspective and direction.
            Miyazaki, however, wanted the ships that appeared in Ponyo to be
            drawn frame-by-frame.[17] A few previous Studio Ghibli films used
            computer-generated imagery (CGI), the earliest being Princess
            Mononoke (1997).[18] For the production of Ponyo however, the
            computer graphics section at the studio was closed to prioritize
            hand-drawn animation.[19] Some elements of the film were inspired by
            Richard Wagner's opera Die Walküre.[20] Ponyo's birth name,
            Brunhilde, is a deliberate reference to the eldest of the nine
            legendary Valkyrie and Wagner's Brünnhilde. The music also makes
            reference to Wagner's opera. The character of Sōsuke is based on
            Miyazaki's son Gorō Miyazaki when he was five.[21] Miyazaki wanted
            his next film to be a sequel to Ponyo, but producer Toshio Suzuki
            convinced him to make The Wind Rises instead.[22]

            The film was rated #2 on Dentsu's list of "2008 Hit Products in
            Japan", after the Wii console.[54] Ponyo was an entrant in the 65th
            Venice International Film Festival.[55] It received a special
            mention in the Bologna Future Film Festival, for "the high artistic
            and expressive quality of animation able to give form to wonderful
            imagination of the worldwide cinema master".[56] In 2009, Ponyo won
            five awards at the 8th annual Tokyo Anime Awards. The awards
            included "Anime of the year" and "Best domestic feature". Miyazaki
            received the award for best director and best original story, and
            Noboru Yoshida received the award for best art direction.[57] The
            film won the awards for Animation of the Year and Outstanding
            Achievement in Music at the 32nd Japan Academy Prize.[58]
