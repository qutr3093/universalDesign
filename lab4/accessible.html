          <h2>About Yoshimoto Nara</h2>
          <p>
            Yoshitomo Nara is one of the most beloved contemporary Japanese
            artists. The protagonist in his works, a girl with big, wide eyes
            and often wearing an unhappy look or a sarcastic smile, strikes deep
            resonance among people, especially the young ones who see in the
            girl shared loneliness and growing pains and a rejection of the
            adults' world.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yoshitomo Nara is a pioneering figure in contemporary art whose
            signature style—which expresses children in a range of emotional
            complexities from resistance and rebellion to quietude and
            contemplation—celebrates the introspective freedom of the
            imagination and the individual.

          <h2>Yoshitomo Nara, Miss Forest / Thinker, 2016</h2>
          <p>
            For Nara, the type of institution or the size of a space matters
            less than how connected he feels with its environment and his
            approach to art is similarly dependent on his sense of connection
            with its making. In 2011, the Great East Japan Earthquake and
            Tsunami greatly affected Nara’s worldview and impacted the work he
            made after that time. Still bearing the style he had developed
            throughout his oeuvre, this later work marked a thoughtfulness and
            pathos that seemed to reflect on themes such as impermanence,
            temporality, beauty, and the present. In the Milky Lake/Thinking One
            (2011), the first painting he made after the disaster, exudes the
            meditative and thoughtful figures that marked a shift in his
            practice and could be seen in Thinker (2017), at Pace in New York,
            and Ceramic Works And… (2018), at Pace in Hong Kong.

          <h2>Yoshitomo Nara, 1.2.3.4., Change the History, 2007,</h2>
          <p>
            A year after Nara’s return to Japan in 2000, his seminal solo
            exhibition titled I DON’T MIND, IF YOU FORGET ME was mounted at the
            Yokohama Museum of Art and displayed Nara’s extensive
            multidisciplinary approach to artmaking. In addition to stuffed
            animals, sculptures, paintings, and drawings, the artist presented
            Fountain of Life (2001), a ceramic sculpture featuring running
            water, and Time of My Life (2001), his “drawing room” installation
            built out of plywood, lit with bare lightbulbs, and filled with
            drawings on paper and various ephemera. This installation would
            anticipate a series of collaborations with the design collective
            graf, such as Yoshitomo Nara + graf: Torre de Málaga (2007), a
            site-specific installation at the Centro de Arte Contemporáneo de
            Málaga in Spain. Torre de Málaga, a towering house, was built out of
            industrial and waste materials collected from the city and included
            the work 1.2.3.4, Change the History (2007), which Nara painted on
            site and mounted onto the tower. Evoking Nara’s spirit of
            collaboration and existential introspection, the exhibition carried
            an implicit criticism of the effects of industrialization and
            globalization.

        <h2>More about Yoshitomo Nara</h2>
        <p>
          Nara first came to the fore of the art world during Japan's Pop art
          movement in the 1990s. The subject matter of his sculptures and
          paintings is deceptively simple: most works depict one seemingly
          innocuous subject (often pastel-hued children and animals drawn with
          confident, cartoonish lines) with little or no background. But these
          children, who appear at first to be cute and even vulnerable,
          sometimes brandish weapons like knives and saws. Their wide eyes often
          hold accusatory looks that could be sleepy-eyed irritation at being
          awoken from a nap—or that could be undiluted expressions of hate.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2019, Nara's installation art Not Everything but/ Green House
          (2009) was sold for a new record price of HK$40.12m (US$5.12m) at Poly
          Auction Hong Kong. However, this record only lasted for a few hours.
          Knife Behind Back (2000), a large-scale painting by Nara, just sold at
          Sotheby's Contemporary Art Evening Sale in Hong Kong for HK$195.7m
          (US$25m), nearly five times its record. The new record is also a
          milestone for Nara as he becomes the most expensive Japanese
          artist.[12] Can’t Wait ‘til the Night Comes was sold for HK$92.9m at
          the same year. In April 2021, the painting Frog Girl was sold in
          Sotheby's Hong Kong Spring auction for US$12.5 million.[13]

        <h2>Influences</h2>
        <p>
          Though Nara claims to have never said that he was influenced by manga,
          the imagery of manga and anime of his 1960s childhood is often cited
          when discussing Nara's stylized, large-eyed figures. Nara subverts
          these images, however, by infusing his works with horror-like imagery.
          This juxtaposition of human evil with the innocent child may be a
          reaction to Japan's rigid social conventions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nara, however, does not see his weapon-wielding subjects as
          aggressors. "Look at them, they [the weapons] are so small, like toys.
          Do you think they could fight with those?" he says. "I don't think so.
          Rather, I kind of see the children among other, bigger, bad people all
          around them, who are holding bigger knives..."[8] Lauded by art
          critics, Nara's bizarrely intriguing works have gained him a cult
          following around the world.[7] Large original paintings regularly sell
          for millions of dollars.[9] In June, 2005, Nara's artwork was featured
          in the album titled "Suspended Animation" by experimental band
          Fantômas. Other commercial products (including videos, books,
          magazines, catalogues and monographs) have been dedicated to Nara's
          work. Recently, a two-volume catalogue raisonné of all his sculptures,
          paintings, and drawings was completed.[10] Light My Fire from 2001 In
          2010, the Asia Society showed Yoshitomo Nara: Nobody's Fool the first
          major New York exhibition of his work.[11] Other major retrospectives
          include: "I Don't Mind If You Forget Me", which toured Japan between
          2001 and 2002; and "Yoshitomo Nara: Nothing Ever Happens," which
          traveled the United States from 2003 to 2005.[10] One of his exhibited
          works is now part of a window of the Baltic Centre for Contemporary
          Art in Gateshead, England.
